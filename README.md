# Two-Way-Communication

Usage

1. Load the solution (Two Way Communication.sln) file to Visual Studio and build project. 
2. Executables for Fox, Cat and Communication projects are saved in the Debug folder.
3. Running the Communication.exe executable opens a command window. The server establishes sockets for itself and a client. 
4. Once the client is connected, data exchange can take place.
5. Both Fox and Cat have their separate executables, hence two command windows are opened, one for each Fox and Cat. Concurrent data transfer is possible.
